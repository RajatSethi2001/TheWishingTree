File Name: TheWishingTree.py

Basis: This is A semi-story based trivia game. There are six magical trees, each with a special item and guarded by a wizard.
       Each tree represents a different subject (i.e. Sakura Tree = Biology, Oak Tree = Literature, Redwood Tree = Physics).
       To obtain the item, you must answer the wizard's 10 questions. Get three of them wrong and you will be kicked out of 
        the tree and have to start all over again. Once all six trees have been defeated, you unlock access to the final tree,
        Yggdrasil. 

Side Note: This game is still in a beta phase. I plan on adding more questions, answer revelations if incorrect, and a few other
           gadgets to help the player.
